# Driving Insights With R

R is a powerful statistic and graphics language and environment used by many individual to get work done with data. In this short training, participants will learn about R, install a working version on their computer, get familiar with the language and environment and take it out for a simple test drive. By the end of this workshop, a participant should:

- Know what R and RStudio are (pun intended!)
- Have a working version of R and RStudio on their computers
- Be familiar with some features of RStudio
- Know some basic commands of the R language
- Know how to utilise R packages
- Know where to go for a deeper dive into R

### Part 1: Introduction & Overview

#### About R
#### Downloading & Setup
  - Download R from CRAN website
  - Download RStudio IDE from [RStudio website](https://cran.r-project.org/)

  - **Exercise 1**: Setup  RStudio on Your Computer
    1. Go to [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/), download your version of R and get it installed on your computer.
    - Go to [RStudio website](http://www.rstudio.com), download your version of RStudio IDE and get it installed on your computer.

#### Getting Familiar with RStudio
  RStudio is a powerful Integrated Development Environment(IDE) that provides a convenient environment to run R-related tasks and projects easily. I will briefly review some of the keys features of RStudio but see this [cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf) for more details.
  - Menus
  - Panes/Windows
    - Source Editor
    - Console
  - Help

  - Exercise 2:
    1. Create a new R Project

#### Some Basic R Commands
  - **Data Containers**: vector, matrix, array, dataframe, list.
  - **Data Formats**:
  - **Functions**: str, length, dim, names, summary, ls, help/?,  

### Part 2: Getting Hands-on

#### Working Dataset: Ghana Health Facilities Dataset
#### The Power of R Packages
#### Building Your Data Pipeline
At School of Data, we like to think about the data analysis process as a pipeline. Below is a framework we usually use:
